1,Generate 5 shipments from Atlanta to Miami. All shipments should weigh exactly 4500 pounds.,Easy,totalWeightLbs - exact value
2,Create 8 shipments from Chicago to Detroit. Each shipment between 3000 and 5000 pounds.,Easy,totalWeightLbs - range
3,Generate 6 shipments from Los Angeles to Phoenix. Total weight across all shipments should be 30000 pounds.,Easy,totalWeightLbs - aggregate
4,Generate 12 shipments from Atlanta to Miami. Weight 4000-5000 lbs and volume 2800-3200 cubic feet per shipment.,Medium,Weight + Volume combination
5,Create 15 shipments from Chicago to Detroit. Each 22-26 pallets with 1320-1560 cases.,Medium,Pallets + Cases combination
6,Generate 10 shipments from Los Angeles to Phoenix. Weight 5000 lbs volume 3000 cuft 24 pallets 1440 cases all consistent.,Medium,All quantity fields consistent
7,Generate 12 shipments from Atlanta to Miami. Each shipment must have a 2-hour delivery window. None of the delivery windows can overlap with each other. All deliveries must happen between March 1st and March 5th 2026. Delivery windows can only start at these times: 6 AM 9 AM 12 PM 3 PM or 6 PM. Each shipment 4000-5000 pounds.,Hard,Non-overlapping time window constraint satisfaction
8,Create 15 shipments from Chicago to various destinations in Ohio. Total aggregate weight must be exactly 90000 pounds. Each shipment weight must be divisible by 500. The mean weight should be 6000 pounds with standard deviation of 1200 pounds. No two shipments can have the exact same weight.,Hard,Weight distribution with modulo and uniqueness constraints
9,Generate 20 shipments from Texas to California. The ratio of total pallets to total cases must be exactly 1:60. The ratio of total weight to total volume must be 1.8 pounds per cubic foot. Average pallets per shipment should be 24. Weight range 5000-8000 pounds per shipment.,Hard,Circular dependency with multiple ratio constraints
10,Create 18 shipments from Atlanta to Charlotte. Generate weights such that when sorted in ascending order the differences between consecutive weights form an arithmetic sequence. For example if sorted weights are W1 W2 W3... then W2-W1 W3-W2 W4-W3 etc must have constant difference. Total weight 108000 pounds. Range 4000-8000 pounds per shipment.,Very Hard,Arithmetic progression constraint on sorted differences
11,Generate 15 shipments from Seattle to Portland. Pallet counts must be: 8 13 21 34 55 for first 5 shipments then repeat pattern twice more for remaining 10 shipments. Total cases must be exactly 18000. Cases per pallet must be inversely proportional to pallet count meaning shipments with more pallets have fewer cases per pallet. Weight proportional to total cases. Range 4000-7000 pounds.,Very Hard,Fibonacci pattern with inverse proportionality constraint
12,Create 28 shipments from Houston to various Texas cities over 7 days March 1-7 2026. Exactly 4 shipments per day. Daily total weight must form strictly increasing sequence meaning Day 1 total less than Day 2 total less than Day 3 total etc. Each day must have exactly one shipment from each weight category: Light 2000-3000 lbs Medium 4000-5000 lbs Heavy 6000-7000 lbs Super 8000-9000 lbs. All 7 days must satisfy the increasing total constraint.,Very Hard,Strictly increasing daily totals with categorical distribution
